StackOverflow published its **Developer Survey 2020**. Click [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020) for details.

In 2020, 
**Python**, **Go**, **TypeScript**, **Rust** are the programming language most loved by developers in the world.
It means that these languages are in vogue and new learners are on the rise.
While **JavaScript** swallows everything, **Perl**, **PHP**, and **Ruby** seem to be still in high demand.

Frameworks packaging frontends, backends and database into one, such as Rails, are already not preferred.
Today, dividing frontends with **JavaScript** (**Node.js**, **Vue.js**, **React.js**) 
and backends/database with scalable cloud services (**AWS**, **GCP**)
is major approach for adaptive web applications.

**Python** and **Java** have always been very popular 
and in demand as general languages that can be used for many purposes.
In the future, it will be interesting to see if **Go** and **Rust** can take their place.

Finally, I would like to introduce the cluster map of major development technologies found by the StackOverflow Developer Survey 2020. 
With the penetration of new technologies such as **mobile**, **container** and **cloud computing**, 
it will be more difficult to become a full-stack engineer in the near future.
