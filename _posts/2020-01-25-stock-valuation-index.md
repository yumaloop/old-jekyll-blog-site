### 1. EV/EBITA



EV

[Enterprise value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/enterprisevalue.asp) (EV) is a measure of the economic value of a company. It is considered to be a better valuation measure than [market capitalization](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp), since the latter doesn't regard to the debt.
$$
~ \\
\begin{align}
\text{EV} 
&= (\text{Market capitalization}) + (\text{value of debt}) \\
&\hspace{1.5em} + \text{(minority interest)} + \text{(preferred shares)} - (\text{cash and cash equivalents})
\end{align}

\begin{align}
\text{EBITDA}

&= \text{(Operating income)} + \text{(DE)} + \text{(AE)}

\end{align}

\text{EV/EBITDA} &= \frac{(\text{Market capitalization}) + (\text{Interest-bearing debt}) - (\text{Cash equivalent})}{\text{(Operating Profit)} + \text{(Depreciation)}}
