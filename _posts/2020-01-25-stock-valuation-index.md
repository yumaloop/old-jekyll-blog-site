### 1. EV/EBITA



EV

[Enterprise value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/enterprisevalue.asp) (EV) is a measure of the economic value of a company. It is considered to be a better valuation measure than [market capitalization](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp), since the latter doesn't regard to the debt.
$$
~ \\
\begin{align}
\text{EV} 
&= (\text{Market capitalization}) + (\text{value of debt}) \\
&\hspace{1.5em} + \text{(minority interest)} + \text{(preferred shares)} - (\text{cash and cash equivalents})
\end{align}
$$

**Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)** indicate a company's earning before interest, taxes, and depreciation. **Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA)** indicates.
$$
~ \\
\begin{align}
\text{EBITDA} 
&= \text{(Income before income taxes)} + \text{(IE)} + \text{(DE)} + \text{(AE)} \\
&= \text{(Operating income)} + \text{(DE)} + \text{(AE)}

\end{align}
$$







- EBT: Earnings Before Taxes: 
- EBIT: Earnings Before Interest and Taxes

**Income before income taxes** = Ordinary income + Extraordinary income - Extraordinary loss

Taxes =  Corporation tax, residential tax and business tax + Income taxes-current ...

**Net income** = Income before income taxes - Taxes




















$$
\begin{align}
\text{EV} &:= ge \\
\text{EBITDA} &:= \text{(Operating Profit)} + \text{(Depreciation)} \\ \\
\text{EV/EBITDA} &= \frac{(\text{Market capitalization}) + (\text{Interest-bearing debt}) - (\text{Cash equivalent})}{\text{(Operating Profit)} + \text{(Depreciation)}}
\end{align}
$$









- **EBITDA = Earnings Before Tax + Interest + Depreciation + Amortization**



$$\text{AE}$$: Amortization Expense 

$$\text{DE}$$: Depreciation Expense

$$\text{IE}$$: Interest expense
