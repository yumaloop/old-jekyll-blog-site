[Simon Wood](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=EskiIyEAAAAJ&hl=en), a leading statistician in UK being famous for the text book of the GAMs introduced the lockdown reading list in his [homepage](https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~sw15190/). It looks interesting, so I'll share it here. (most of them are [Blackwell's, books](https://blackwells.co.uk/bookshop/home))

- [Collapse](https://blackwells.co.uk/bookshop/product/Collapse-by-Jared-M-Diamond/9780241958681) (Jared Diamond) on how societies are destroyed, not by external forces, but by their failure to adapt their cultural norms to those forces.
- [Thinking Fast and Slow](https://blackwells.co.uk/bookshop/product/Thinking-Fast-and-Slow-by-Daniel-Kahneman/9780141033570) (Daniel Kahneman) on the pitfalls of our intuitive reasoning, especially about risk and uncertainty.
- [Mistakes were made, but not by me](https://blackwells.co.uk/bookshop/product/Mistakes-Were-Made-But-Not-by-Me-by-Carol-Tavris-Elliot-Aronson/9780544574786) (Carol Tarvis and Elliot Aronson) on the psychology of sticking with bad decisions.
- [The Parable of the Old Man and the Young](https://poets.org/poem/parable-old-man-and-young) by Wilfred Owen, on consequences of the above.
- [Economics The User's Guide](https://blackwells.co.uk/bookshop/product/Economics-by-Ha-Joon-Chang-author/9780718197032) (Ha-Joon Chang) on what you really need to know about economics, and how it isn't just a scaled up version of household accounting.
- [The Great Crash 1929](https://blackwells.co.uk/bookshop/product/The-Great-Crash-1929-by-John-Kenneth-Galbraith/9780141038254) (Galbraith) a delightful disection of economic hubris (and the need for stabilizing controls that we long since did away with).
- [The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich](https://blackwells.co.uk/bookshop/product/The-Rise-and-Fall-of-the-Third-Reich-by-William-L-Shirer-author/9781451651683) (William Shirer) detailing exactly how things went wrong in Germany after the Great Depression.
- [Witch hunting in Scotland](https://blackwells.co.uk/bookshop/product/Witch-Hunting-in-Scotland-by-Brian-P-Levack/9780415399432) (Brian Levack) on the Scottish experience of the great European witchcraft panic (James I/VI wrote a treatise on Witchcraft).
- [Wood and Thomas paper](https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~sw15190/WT99.pdf) on the problems of prediction with disease models in the absense of direct validation data (the least impressive item here).
