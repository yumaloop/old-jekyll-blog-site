#### Journals

* Visual Cognition
  - 1994-ongoing
  - IF: 1.238 (2017-2019)
  - Categories: Arts & Humanities, Neuroscience, Psychology
  - [latest issues (online archive)](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/pvis20/28/5-8?nav=tocList)
  - [SCI Journal link](https://www.scijournal.org/impact-factor-of-visual-cognition.shtml)
  - about: Visual Cognition publishes new empirical research that increases theoretical understanding of human visual cognition. Studies may be concerned with any aspect of visual cognition such as object, face, and scene recognition; visual attention and search; short-term and long-term visual memory; visual word recognition and reading; eye movement control and active vision; and visual imagery. The journal is devoted to research at the interface of visual perception and cognition and does not typically publish papers in areas of perception or psychophysics that are covered by the many publication outlets for those topics.

* MDPI Entropy
  - 1999-ongoing
  - IF: 2.860 (2017-2019)
  - Categories: Physics and Astronomy
  - [latest issues (online archive)](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/22/1)
  - [SCI Journal link](https://www.scijournal.org/impact-factor-of-entropy-switz.shtml)
  －about: Entropy, an international and interdisciplinary journal of entropy and information studies, publishes reviews, regular research papers and short notes. If there are computation and the experiment, the details must be provided so that the results can be reproduced. There are in addition three unique features: •Manuscripts regarding research proposals and research ideas will be particularly welcome. •Comments on any related papers published in this journal and other journals can be published as short letters. •Electronic files regarding the full details of the calculation and experimental procedure, if unable to be published in a normal way, will be deposited as supplementary material.

* Perception
  - 1972-ongoing
  - IF: 1.349 (2017-2019)
  - Categories: Computer Science, Medicine, Neuroscience
  - [latest issues (online archive link)](https://journals.sagepub.com/toc/PEC/current)
  - [SCI Journal link](https://www.scijournal.org/impact-factor-of-perception.shtml)
  - about: Perception is a scholarly journal reporting experimental results and theoretical ideas ranging over the fields of human, animal, and machine perception. Topics covered include physiological mechanisms and clinical neurological disturbances; psychological data on pattern and object perception in animals and man; the role of experience in developing perception; skills, such as driving and flying; effects of culture on perception and aesthetics; errors, illusions, and perceptual phenomena occurring in controlled conditions, with emphasis on their theoretical significance; cognitive experiments and theories relating knowledge to perception.
