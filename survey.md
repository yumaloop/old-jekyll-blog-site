#### Journals

* Visual Cognition
  - 1994-ongoing
  - IF: 1.238 (2017-2019)
  - Categories: Arts & Humanities, Neuroscience, Psychology
  - [latest issues (online archive)](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/pvis20/28/5-8?nav=tocList)
  - [SCI Journal link](https://www.scijournal.org/impact-factor-of-visual-cognition.shtml)
  - about: Visual Cognition publishes new empirical research that increases theoretical understanding of human visual cognition. Studies may be concerned with any aspect of visual cognition such as object, face, and scene recognition; visual attention and search; short-term and long-term visual memory; visual word recognition and reading; eye movement control and active vision; and visual imagery. The journal is devoted to research at the interface of visual perception and cognition and does not typically publish papers in areas of perception or psychophysics that are covered by the many publication outlets for those topics.

* MDPI Entropy
  - 1999-ongoing
  - IF: 2.860 (2017-2019)
  - Categories: Physics and Astronomy
  - [latest issues (online archive)](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/22/1)
  - [SCI Journal link](https://www.scijournal.org/impact-factor-of-entropy-switz.shtml)
  －about: Entropy, an international and interdisciplinary journal of entropy and information studies, publishes reviews, regular research papers and short notes. If there are computation and the experiment, the details must be provided so that the results can be reproduced. There are in addition three unique features: •Manuscripts regarding research proposals and research ideas will be particularly welcome. •Comments on any related papers published in this journal and other journals can be published as short letters. •Electronic files regarding the full details of the calculation and experimental procedure, if unable to be published in a normal way, will be deposited as supplementary material.

  - about: The journal provides research and review papers at an interdisciplinary level, with the field of intelligent systems for computational neuroscience as its focus. This field includes areas like artificial intelligence, models and computational theories of human cognition, perception and motivation; brain models, artificial neural nets and neural computing. All items relevant to building theoretical and practical systems are within its scope, including contributions in the area of applicable neural networks theory, supervised and unsupervised learning methods, algorithms, architectures, performance measures, applied statistics, software simulations, hardware implementations, benchmarks, system engineering and integration and innovative applications.

* Perception
  - 1972-ongoing
  - IF: 1.349 (2017-2019)
  - Categories: Computer Science, Medicine, Neuroscience
  - [latest issues (online archive link)](https://journals.sagepub.com/toc/PEC/current)
  - [SCI Journal link](https://www.scijournal.org/impact-factor-of-perception.shtml)
  - about: Perception is a scholarly journal reporting experimental results and theoretical ideas ranging over the fields of human, animal, and machine perception. Topics covered include physiological mechanisms and clinical neurological disturbances; psychological data on pattern and object perception in animals and man; the role of experience in developing perception; skills, such as driving and flying; effects of culture on perception and aesthetics; errors, illusions, and perceptual phenomena occurring in controlled conditions, with emphasis on their theoretical significance; cognitive experiments and theories relating knowledge to perception.

* Attention, Perception & Psychophysics
  - 2009-ongoing
  - IF: 2.000 (2017-2019)
  - Categories: Arts and Humanities, Neuroscience, Psychology
  - [latest issues (online archive link)](https://www.springer.com/journal/13414)
  - [SCI Journal link](https://www.scijournal.org/impact-factor-of-percept-psychophys.shtml)
  - about: Attention, Perception, & Psychophysics covers all areas of research in sensory processes, perception, attention, and psychophysics. Most articles are reports of experimental work. Theoretical, integrative, and evaluative reviews are also published, while commentary on issues of importance to researchers appears in a special section of the journal.

- Cognitive Systems Research
  - 1999-ongoing
  - IF: 2.615 (2017-2019)
  - Categories: Computer Science, Neuroscience, Psychology
  - [latest issues (online archive link)](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/cognitive-systems-research/)
  - [SCI Journal link](https://www.scijournal.org/impact-factor-of-cogn-syst-res.shtml)
  - about: Cognitive Systems Research covers all topics in the study of cognitive processes, in both natural and artificial systems. The journal seeks top-quality contributions and encourages, in particular, articles that transcend traditional disciplinary boundaries (in terms of implications or in terms of approaches). (1) The journal emphasizes the integration/synthesis of ideas, concepts, constructs, theories, and techniques from multiple paradigms, perspectives, and disciplines, in the analysis, understanding, and design of cognitive and intelligent systems. (2) Contributions describing results obtained within the traditional disciplines (e.g., psychology, artificial intelligence) using well-established paradigms are also sought (especially if such work has broader implications and relevance).
