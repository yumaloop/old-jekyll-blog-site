I'm Yuma Uchiumi, a graduate student majoring in computer science.
I was born on December 8, 1997 in Tokyo, Japan.  [see CV](https://yumaloop.github.io/assets/pdf/CV202011.pdf)<br>
My research goal is to understand and implement the computation for human thinking;
I study statistical algorithms, stochastic models, and information processing systems to solve the cognitive problems with human thinking.
